# THIS FILE CONTAINS BOTH BUILDTIME AD RUNTIME PROPERTIES FOR THE MICROSERVICE
# THEY GENERALLY CONFIGURED IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT WORKS WITH LOCAL DEVELOPMENT OR DEVELOPER ACCOUNT, IE: TEST/TESTDEV/DEVELOPER STAGE

# TEAM BEFORE MAKING THESE FOLLOWING CHANGES
# * DEFAULT VALUES
# * RENAME OF PROPERTY
# * ADDITION OF PROPERTY
# * REMOVAL OF PROPERTY
